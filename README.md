# 🧠 Generative AI Study Log

Welcome to my **Generative AI Study Log**! 🚀

This repository tracks my ongoing journey through the world of Generative AI — including key models, coding exercises and implementations.

## 🗂️ Topics Covered

### ✅ Deep Learning from Scratch (DLscratch5)
- Basic concept of Generative AI
- VAE, DDPM will be covered
- The official code is available at [DL5](https://github.com/WegraLee/deep-learning-from-scratch-5/tree/main)

### ✅ Diffusion Models
- Understanding denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM)
- Implementing and visualizing diffusion steps
- Applications in image generation

### ✅ Probability and Statistics Fundamentals
- Core concepts essential for understanding generative models
- Probability distributions, expectation, variance, KL divergence, MLE etc..

## 📌 Goal
To deeply understand and reproduce generative AI models from scratch where possible, while logging experiments, notes, and key findings.
