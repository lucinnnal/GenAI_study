# Generative AI Study - Day 6

## Conditional Diffusion Model Training and Generation

Day6 activity demonstrates the implementation and training of a **Conditional Diffusion Model** using PyTorch. The model is trained to generate images conditioned on class labels (e.g., digits from MNIST).

### Key Activities
- Understanding Conditional Diffusion Models
- Implementing forward and reverse diffusion processes
- Applying condition embeddings to guide generation
- Generating samples conditioned on class labels

### Tools and Environment
- Python, PyTorch
- torchvision (e.g., MNIST dataset)
-  VSCode

### Results
- Generated samples accurately reflected the specified conditions (labels)
- Improved quality over unconditional generation
